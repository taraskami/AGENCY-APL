The scripts in this directory need to be run by the Postgres super user. (*)


There are two steps involved:

1) Create a user(**) and a database.

Sample using Postgres scripts:
(Run these from the command line, not within Postgres)

createuser -P my_user

createdb -O my_user my_database

2) Run the "install.pg_super_user_stuff.sql" script

It might look something like this:

su postgres
psql my_database
\i install.pg_super_user_stuff.sql


------

NOTE: systems can vary, and your setup might be different.

(*) The superuser is probably "postgres"

(**) You may have an exsiting database user, in which case skip the createuser part
